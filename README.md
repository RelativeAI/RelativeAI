Overview
This project implements a multi-agent system designed to collaboratively explore, apply, and teach physics concepts, with a focus on Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. The system consists of four specialized agents, each with distinct roles, working concurrently under the supervision of a coordinator. The architecture leverages the GPT-4o model to power the agents, ensuring robust and accurate processing of physics-related tasks.
System Architecture
Architecture Type: Concurrent
The agents operate simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing of tasks such as theoretical analysis, practical application, and educational material preparation.

Model: GPT-4o
All agents utilize the GPT-4o model for advanced natural language understanding and generation.

Agents
The system includes the following agents, each with a unique role and responsibilities:
1. PhysicsMasterCoordinator
Role: Oversees the entire operation, manages workflow, and synthesizes outputs from all agents.

Description: This agent acts as the central coordinator, ensuring effective collaboration among sub-agents. It distributes tasks, resolves conflicts, and compiles a comprehensive report on physics mastery by integrating outputs from other agents.

Responsibilities:
Manage workflow and task distribution.

Regularly check in with sub-agents for progress updates.

Handle errors by reassigning tasks or requesting re-evaluations.

Synthesize agent outputs into a final report.

Example Output: A detailed explanation of the theory of relativity, covering both special and general relativity, including key principles and implications.

2. PhysicsTheoryExpert
Role: Provides deep insights into theoretical physics.

Description: Focuses on exploring and explaining complex physics concepts, such as the theory of relativity, with detailed derivations and theoretical findings.

Responsibilities:
Generate detailed reports on theoretical physics.

Collaborate with PhysicsApplicationExpert and PhysicsTeachingAssistant for accurate application and communication.

Handle errors by consulting the PhysicsMasterCoordinator for clarification.

Focus: Theoretical foundations, such as time dilation, length contraction, and spacetime curvature.

3. PhysicsApplicationExpert
Role: Applies theoretical physics to practical scenarios.

Description: Takes theoretical insights from the PhysicsTheoryExpert and applies them to real-world contexts, such as GPS technology and particle accelerators.

Responsibilities:
Generate reports on practical applications of physics theories.

Collaborate with PhysicsTeachingAssistant to ensure applications are teachable.

Handle errors by revising applications or consulting the PhysicsMasterCoordinator.

Example Output: A report detailing how special and general relativity are applied in GPS technology and astrophysics.

4. PhysicsTeachingAssistant
Role: Assists in teaching and disseminating physics knowledge.

Description: Prepares educational materials based on inputs from the PhysicsTheoryExpert and PhysicsApplicationExpert, ensuring clarity and accessibility.

Responsibilities:
Create tutorials, FAQs, and teaching aids.

Collaborate with experts for accuracy and clarity.

Revise materials based on feedback or new insights.

Focus: Simplifying complex ideas (e.g., spacetime curvature) with analogies, visual aids, and hands-on examples.

Data Structure
The system is represented as a JSON object with the following key components:
Nodes: An array of agent objects, each containing:
id: Unique identifier for the agent.

type: Specifies the node type (always "agent" in this case).

data: Contains agent details such as name, systemPrompt, description, model, and lastResult (if available).

position: X and Y coordinates for visualization purposes.

isProcessing: Boolean indicating whether the agent is currently active.

Edges: An empty array (no explicit connections defined in this version, as agents collaborate implicitly via the coordinator).

Architecture: Specifies the concurrent processing model.

Results: A key-value store mapping agent IDs to their latest outputs.

Example Usage
The system has been used to generate detailed content on the theory of relativity, including:
Theoretical Overview: Provided by PhysicsTheoryExpert and coordinated by PhysicsMasterCoordinator, covering special relativity (e.g., E=mc2E=mc^2E=mc^2
) and general relativity (e.g., gravitational waves).

Practical Applications: Detailed by PhysicsApplicationExpert, such as relativity corrections in GPS and particle accelerators.

Educational Materials: Prepared by PhysicsTeachingAssistant (in progress), simplifying concepts for teaching purposes.

Running the System
Setup: Ensure the GPT-4o model is accessible via an API or local deployment.

Initialization: Load the JSON configuration into a compatible multi-agent framework.

Execution: Trigger the PhysicsMasterCoordinator to begin task distribution and oversee agent collaboration.

Output: Retrieve synthesized reports and educational materials from the results field or individual agent lastResult entries.

Notes
The system is designed to handle errors gracefully, with agents consulting the PhysicsMasterCoordinator for guidance or re-evaluation.

Duplicate agent entries in the JSON (e.g., multiple PhysicsMasterCoordinator instances) may reflect versioning or testing states; ensure only one active instance per role during deployment.

The current focus is on the theory of relativity, but the system can be adapted to other physics topics by modifying agent prompts.

Future Enhancements
Define explicit edges to model agent interactions more granularly.

Expand the scope to include additional physics domains (e.g., quantum mechanics).

Integrate real-time visualization of agent positions and outputs.
